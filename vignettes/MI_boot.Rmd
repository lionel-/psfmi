# Introduction

This page contains information of the `MI_boot` method that is implemented 
in the [`psfmi`](https://github.com/mwheymans/psfmi) package and that combines 
Multiple Imputation with bootstrapping for the validation of 
logistic regression / prediction models. Currently the method is only available 
via downloading the `psfmi` package via Github. Do this:

 install.packages("devtools")
 
 library(devtools)
 
 devtools::install_github("mwheymans/psfmi")
 
 library(psfmi)

The `MI_boot` method is implemented in the function `psfmi_perform`.
An explanation and examples of how to use the methods can be found below.

# Method MI_boot

With this method bootstrap samples are drawn from each multiply imputed dataset. 
The same cases are drawn in each imputed dataset. The pooled model is analyzed 
in the each bootstrap training data and subsequently tested in original multiply imputed data. 
The method can be performed in combination with backward or forward selection.

How these steps work is visualized in figure (Figure \@ref(fig:miboot))

# Examples

* [Method MI_boot]
* [Method MI_boot including BW selection]
* [Method MI_boot including FW selection]

## Method MI_boot 

To run the MI_boot method use:

```{r}

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, formula = Chronic ~ Pain + JobDemands + rcs(Tampascale, 3) +
                   factor(Satisfaction) + Smoking, p.crit = 1, direction="FW",
                 nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", method="D1")

set.seed(200)
res <- psfmi_perform(pool_lr, val_method = "MI_boot", nboot = 5, p.crit=1)
res

  
```

## Method MI_boot including BW selection

To run the MI_boot method including backward selection:

```{r}

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, formula = Chronic ~ Pain + JobDemands + rcs(Tampascale, 3) +
                   factor(Satisfaction) + Smoking, p.crit = 1, direction="FW",
                 nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", method="D1")

set.seed(200)
res <- psfmi_perform(pool_lr, val_method = "MI_boot", nboot = 5, p.crit=0.05, direction = "BW")
res

```

Back to [Examples]

## Method MI_boot including FW selection

To run the MI_boot method including forward selection:


```{r}

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, formula = Chronic ~ Pain + JobDemands + rcs(Tampascale, 3) +
                   factor(Satisfaction) + Smoking, p.crit = 1, direction="FW",
                 nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", method="D1")

set.seed(200)
res <- psfmi_perform(pool_lr, val_method = "MI_boot", nboot = 5, p.crit=0.05, direction = "FW")
res

  
```
