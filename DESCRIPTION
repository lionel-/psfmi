Description:
	The psfmi package Provides functions to apply pooling, backward and forward selection 
	of logistic, Cox regression and Multilevel (mixed models) prediction 
	models in multiply imputed datasets. Backward and forward selection can be done 
	from the pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the D1, D2, D3 and 
	the median p-values method. The model can contain	continuous, dichotomous, 
	categorical predictors and interaction terms between all these type of predictors. 
	Continuous predictors	can also be introduced as restricted cubic spline coefficients. 
	The package includes a function to evaluate the stability 
	of the models	using bootstrapping and cluster bootstrapping. The package further 
	contains functions to generate pooled model performance measures in multiply 
	imputed datasets as ROC/AUC, R-squares, scaled Brier score, fit test values and 
	calibration	plots for logistic regression models. 
	Internal validation of the developed model can be performed with cross-validation or 
	bootstrapping. The adjusted intercept after shrinkage of the pooled regression 
	coefficients can be subsequently obtained. Backward and forward selection as part of 
	internal validation ispossible. Also a function to externally validate logistic	
	prediction models in multiple imputed datasets is available.
