Description:
	Package contains functions to apply pooling or backward selection 
	for logistic or Cox regression prediction models. Backward selection is 
	done from the pooled model on basis of the Wald p-value. The model
	can contain continuous, dichotomous, categorical predictors, interaction
	terms between all type of these predictors. Continuous predictors
	can also be introduced as restricted cubic spline coefficients. 
	For categorical and spline predictors, the overall p-value is obtained 
	by pooling the total covariance matrix (D1 method),	pooling Chi-square 
	values (D2 method), pooling Likelihood ratio statistics	
	(method of Meng and Rubin) or pooling the median p-values (MPR rule). 
	For continuous and dichotomous variables Rubin's rules are used
	as the basic pooling method, although one of the four methods 
	can also be chosen. The package also contains functions to generate 
	apparent model performance measures over imputed datasets as ROC/AUC, 
	Nagelkerke R-squares, Hosmer & Lemeshow test values and calibration
	plots. A wrapper function over Frank Harrell's validate function is 
	used for that. Bootstrap internal validation is performed in each 
	imputed dataset results are pooled. Backward selection as part of 
	internal validation	is  optional and recommended.
