Description: 
	Package contains functions that apply pooling or backward selection 
	for a prediction model with logistic regression. For categorical predictors, 
	the overall p-value is obtained by pooling the total covariance matrix (D1 method), 
	pooling Chi-square values (D2 method), pooling Likelihood ratio statistics 
	(method of Meng and Rubin) or pooling the median p-values (MPR rule). 
	For continuous or dichotomous variables Rubin?s rules are used, 
	although one of the four methods can also be chosen.
