Description:
	Package contains functions to apply pooling or backward selection 
	for logistic or Cox regression prediction models in multiple imputed
	datasets. Backward selection can be done from the pooled model using 
	Rubin's Rules (RR), the total covariance matrix (D1 method), pooling 
	Chi-square values (D2 method), pooling Likelihood ratio statistics	
	(method of Meng and Rubin or D3) or pooling the median p-values (MPR rule). 
	The model	can contain continuous, dichotomous, categorical predictors 
	and interaction terms between all	type of these predictors. 
	Continuous predictors	can also be introduced as restricted cubic spline
	(RCS) coefficients. It is also possible to force (spline) predictors 
	or interaction terms in the model during predictor selection.
	The package also contains functions to generate apparent model performance 
	measures over imputed datasets as ROC/AUC, Nagelkerke R-squares, 
	Hosmer & Lemeshow test values and calibration	plots. A wrapper function 
	over Frank Harrell's validate function is	used for that. 
	Bootstrap internal validation is performed in each imputed dataset and 
	results are pooled. Backward selection as part of internal validation	
	is optional and recommended.
