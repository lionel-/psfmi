## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
Started the Description with just "Provides..." and did not capitalize non-names (e.g. Likelihood - likelihood).

I have added references as  (year) <doi:...>  

I have changed my examples into small executable examples in all of my Rd-files.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
Omitted the mis-spelled words, the date field and adjusted the examples so that they run <5s.
